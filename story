Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who risided on a jamun tree which was on banks of a river.
In the same forest there lived a corocodile and his wife.
One day the corocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The corocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
As days passed by corocodile and monkey became good friends.
